## Where can i get models and voices?

* LLM models can be taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface 
* StableDiffusion, vae, inpaint, embedding and lora models can be taken from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface
* RVC models can be taken from [VoiceModels](https://voice-models.com)
* StableAudio, AudioCraft, AudioLDM 2, TTS, Whisper, MMS, SeamlessM4Tv2, Wav2Lip, LivePortrait, SunoBark, MoonDream2, Upscalers (Latent and Real-ESRGAN), Refiner, GLIGEN, Depth, Pix2Pix, Controlnet, AnimateDiff, HotShot-XL, Videos, LDM3D, SD3, Cascade, T2I-IP-ADAPTER, IP-Adapter-FaceID, Riffusion, Rembg, Roop, CodeFormer, DDColor, PixelOE, Real-ESRGAN, StableFast3D, Shap-E, SV34D, Zero123Plus, UVR, Demucs, Kandinsky, Flux, HunyuanDiT, Lumina-T2X, Kolors, AuraFlow, AuraSR, WÃ¼rstchen, DeepFloydIF, PixArt, PlaygroundV2.5, ModelScope, ZeroScope 2, CogVideoX, Latte and Multiband diffusion models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder when are they used 
* You can take voices anywhere. Record yours or take a recording from the Internet. Or just use those that are already in the project. The main thing is that it is pre-processed!

## Known Bugs:

* SeamlessM4T `both generations` parameter not working with audio
* FLUX `Enable quantized` and `Quantized models` parameters not working at all
* RVC, Supir and SV34D not working at all

## Plans for future:

* Interface: Make a `reload` button to update model lists and gallery
* FLUX: Make a img2img, inpainting, controlnet-union sub-tabs with the appropriate functionality
