Hotshot-XL is an AI text-to-GIF model trained to work alongside [Stable Diffusion XL](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion). 

Hotshot-XL can generate GIFs with any fine-tuned SDXL model. This means two things:
1. You‚Äôll be able to make GIFs with any existing or newly fine-tuned SDXL model you may want to use.
2. If you'd like to make GIFs of personalized subjects, you can load your own SDXL based LORAs, and not have to worry about fine-tuning Hotshot-XL. This is awesome because it‚Äôs usually much easier to find suitable images for training data than it is to find videos. It also hopefully fits into everyone's existing LORA usage/workflows :) See more [here](#text-to-gif-with-personalized-loras).

Hotshot-XL is compatible with SDXL ControlNet to make GIFs in the composition/layout you‚Äôd like. See the [ControlNet](#text-to-gif-with-controlnet) section below.

Hotshot-XL was trained to generate 1 second GIFs at 8 FPS.

Hotshot-XL was trained on various aspect ratios. For best results with the base Hotshot-XL model, we recommend using it with an SDXL model that has been fine-tuned with 512x512 images. You can find an SDXL model we fine-tuned for 512x512 resolutions [here](https://huggingface.co/hotshotco/SDXL-512).

# üåê Try It

Try Hotshot-XL yourself here: https://www.hotshot.co

Or, if you'd like to run Hotshot-XL yourself locally, continue on to the sections below.

If you‚Äôre running Hotshot-XL yourself, you are going to be able to have a lot more flexibility/control with the model. As a very simple example, you‚Äôll be able to change the sampler. We‚Äôve seen best results with Euler-A so far, but you may find interesting results with some other ones.

```

By default, Hotshot-XL will create key frames from your source gif using 8 equally spaced frames and crop the keyframes to the default aspect ratio. For finer grained control, learn how to [vary aspect ratios](#varying-aspect-ratios) and [vary frame rates/lengths](#varying-frame-rates--lengths-experimental).

Hotshot-XL currently supports the use of one ControlNet model at a time; supporting Multi-ControlNet would be [exciting](#-further-work).

### Varying Aspect Ratios

- *Note*: The base SDXL model is trained to best create images around 1024x1024 resolution. To maximize data and training efficiency, Hotshot-XL was trained at aspect ratios around 512x512 resolution. Please see [Additional Notes](#supported-aspect-ratios) for a list of aspect ratios the base Hotshot-XL model was trained with.

Like SDXL, Hotshot-XL was trained at various aspect ratios with aspect ratio bucketing, and includes support for SDXL parameters like target-size and original-size. This means you can create GIFs at several different aspect ratios and resolutions, just with the base Hotshot-XL model. 

```
python inference.py \
  --prompt="a bulldog in the captains chair of a spaceship, hd, high quality" \
  --output="output.gif" \
  --width=<WIDTH> \
  --height=<HEIGHT>
```

*What to Expect:*
|        | 512x512 | 672x384 | 384x672 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **a monkey playing guitar, nature footage, hd, high quality** | <img src="https://dvfx9cgvtgnyd.cloudfront.net/hotshot/inf-temp/2295c6af-c345-47a4-8afe-62e77f84141b.gif"/>         | <img src="https://dvfx9cgvtgnyd.cloudfront.net/hotshot/inf-temp/909a86c5-60df-459a-b662-ce4e85706303.gif"/>          |  <img src="https://dvfx9cgvtgnyd.cloudfront.net/hotshot/inf-temp/8512854d-66ea-41ff-919e-6e36d6e6a541.gif">       |

### Varying frame rates & lengths (*Experimental*)
By default, Hotshot-XL is trained to generate GIFs that are 1 second long with 8FPS. If you'd like to play with generating GIFs with varying frame rates and time lengths, you can try out the parameters `video_length` and `video_duration`.

`video_length` sets the number of frames. The default value is 8.

`video_duration` sets the runtime of the output gif in milliseconds. The default value is 1000.

Please note that you should expect unstable/"jittery" results when modifying these parameters as the model was only trained with 1s videos @ 8fps. You'll be able to improve the stability of results for different time lengths and frame rates by [fine-tuning Hotshot-XL](#-fine-tuning). Please let us know if you do!

```
python inference.py \
  --prompt="a bulldog in the captains chair of a spaceship, hd, high quality" \
  --output="output.gif" \
  --video_length=16 \
  --video_duration=2000
```

### Spatial Layers Only
Hotshot-XL is trained to generate GIFs alongside SDXL. If you'd like to generate just an image, you can simply set `video_length=1` in your inference call and the Hotshot-XL temporal layers will be ignored, as you'd expect.

```
python inference.py \
  --prompt="a bulldog in the captains chair of a spaceship, hd, high quality" \
  --output="output.jpg" \
  --video_length=1 
```

### Additional Notes

#### Supported Aspect Ratios
Hotshot-XL was trained at the following aspect ratios; to reliably generate GIFs outside the range of these aspect ratios, you will want to fine-tune Hotshot-XL with videos at the resolution of your desired aspect ratio.

| Aspect Ratio | Size |
|--------------|------|
| 0.42         |320 x 768|
| 0.57         |384 x 672|
| 0.68         |416 x 608|
| 1.00         |512 x 512|
| 1.46         |608 x 416|
| 1.75         |672 x 384|
| 2.40         |768 x 320|


# üí™ Fine-Tuning
The following section relates to fine-tuning the Hotshot-XL temporal model with additional text/video pairs. If you're trying to generate GIFs of personalized concepts/subjects, we'd recommend not fine-tuning Hotshot-XL, but instead training your own SDXL based LORAs and [just loading those](#text-to-gif-with-personalized-loras).

### Fine-Tuning Hotshot-XL

#### Dataset Preparation

The `fine_tune.py` script expects your samples to be structured like this:

```
fine_tune_dataset
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_001
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0.jpg
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.jpg
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2.jpg
...
...
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n.jpg
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.txt
```

Each sample directory should contain your **n key frames** and a `prompt.txt` file which contains the prompt.
The final checkpoint will be saved to `output_dir`.
We've found it useful to send validation GIFs to [Weights & Biases](www.wandb.ai) every so often. If you choose to use validation with Weights & Biases, you can set how often this runs with the `validate_every_steps` parameter.

```
accelerate launch fine_tune.py \
    --output_dir="<OUTPUT_DIR>" \
    --data_dir="fine_tune_dataset" \
    --report_to="wandb" \
    --run_validation_at_start \
    --resolution=512 \
    --mixed_precision=fp16 \
    --train_batch_size=4 \
    --learning_rate=1.25e-05 \
    --lr_scheduler="constant" \
    --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
    --max_train_steps=1000 \
    --save_n_steps=20 \
    --validate_every_steps=50 \
    --vae_b16 \
    --gradient_checkpointing \
    --noise_offset=0.05 \
    --snr_gamma \
    --test_prompts="man sits at a table in a cafe, he greets another man with a smile and a handshakes"
```

# üìù Further work
There are lots of ways we are excited about improving Hotshot-XL. For example:

- [ ] Fine-Tuning Hotshot-XL at larger frame rates to create longer/higher frame-rate GIFs
- [ ] Fine-Tuning Hotshot-XL at larger resolutions to create higher resolution GIFs
- [ ] Training temporal layers for a latent upscaler to produce higher resolution GIFs
- [ ] Training an image conditioned "frame prediction" model for more coherent, longer GIFs
- [ ] Training temporal layers for a VAE to mitigate flickering/dithering in outputs
- [ ] Supporting Multi-ControlNet for greater control over GIF generation
- [ ] Training & integrating different ControlNet models for further control over GIF generation (finer facial expression control would be very cool)
- [ ] Moving Hotshot-XL into [AITemplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate) for faster inference times

We üíó contributions from the open-source community! Please let us know in the issues or PRs if you're interested in working on these improvements or anything else!
