## This project has been discontinued

Yes, it still works, you can still use this software. It just won't recieve any updates now.

> I do not have the interest or time to oversee the development of this software. I thank all the amazing people who contributed to this project and made what it is in it's final form.

# Roop

> Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

## Installation

Be aware, the installation needs technical skills and is not for beginners. Please do not open platform and installation related issues on GitHub.

[Basic](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.-Installation) - It is more likely to work on your computer, but will be quite slow

[Acceleration](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-Acceleration) - Unleash the full potential of your CPU and GPU


## Usage

```


### Headless

Using the `-s/--source`, `-t/--target` and `-o/--output` argument will run the program in headless mode.
